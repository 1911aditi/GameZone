# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake:
  - Up Arrow: Move Up
  - Down Arrow: Move Down
  - Left Arrow: Move Left
  - Right Arrow: Move Right
- The objective is to eat the fruit that appears randomly on the canvas.
- Each time the snake eats the fruit, it grows in length.
- The game continues until the snake collides with itself.

## Project Structure
